Spike C64 Dislike
-----------------
v1.0 - released June 26th, 2012



About the game:
---------------
This is my first ever Commodore 64 game and it's an adaption of the excellent game Spike Dislike (iOS/PC) by James Gamble. 

Be sure to check out the original game - links can be found at the bottom of this document.



How to play:
------------
Use a joystick in port #2.

Pressing any direction or the firebutton moves the player to the right. Avoid the spikes coming towards you. The interesting thing about the game is the scoring system. Each time you pass a spike your combo-bar will fill up, if you keep passing spikes without letting the combo-bar run out you will get more points for each spike. Also, if you keep the button pressed while passing multiple spikes, a multiplier builds up (to max 4 times the points) which makes an aggressive playing style really rewarding, but also dangerous.
